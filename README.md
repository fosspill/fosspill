# Hey there! 
I'm passionate about making gaming tools that are **accessible**, **cross-platform**, and **open source**. Every single project I work on is designed to give players more freedom to enjoy their games exactly how they want.

### Current Projects

- **Glimmer** - A highlite (Highspell.com) alternative for Android.
- **Infinity Nikki Companion** - Community tools for the world of Miraland ðŸ’–

### Obsolete Projects *(but still close to my heart)*

- **FFXIV Modding Tool** - Cross-platform CLI alternative to TexTools (C#). Final Fantasy XIV Modding should be available to everyone

## My Toolkit

```css
Languages: JavaScript â€¢ C# â€¢ Python
Focus: Cross-platform gaming tools â€¢ Mobile development â€¢ Modding communities  
Philosophy: If it runs on one platform, why not all of them?
Aesthetic/Vibe: Caffeinated beautiful chaos âœ¨
```

## Fun Facts About Me

- I have 65+ repositories full of experiments, passion projects, and delightful disasters
- I genuinely believe the prettiest code is code that works *everywhere* 
- I find cross-platform compatibility genuinely sexy (don't @ me)
- My commit messages range from poetry to pure panic
- I have way too many half-finished projects, but each one taught me something beautiful
